## *SERIOUS*
IF YOU COMPILE THIS PLEASE DONT OPEN THE TEXT FILE! IT CAN CRASH.

## What even is this????
Josty oh me! Josty oh me! Josty oh me! Josty oh me! Josty oh me! Josty oh me! Josty oh me! Josty oh me! Josty oh me! Josty oh me! Josty oh me! Josty oh me! Josty oh me! Josty oh me! Josty oh me! Josty oh me! Josty oh me! Josty oh me! Josty oh me! Josty oh me! 

## Seriously what is this
made some goofy code to create a text file with 100 billion+ characters

## funny thing
Because the code is set to append mode, you can run it multiple times and it will keep adding millions of "Josty oh me!"

## NOTES

I am *NOT* responsible for any malintent this program may be used for such as zip bombing. The power is to the user and this is just for fun!
